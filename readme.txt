A quick and easy shortcode to embed iframe's that resize to the content of the remote site.

== Description ==

A quick and easy shortcode to embed iframe's that resize to the content of the remote site.

Auto iFrame shortcode is in the format of:

	[auto-iframe link=xxx tag=xxx width=xxx height=xxx autosize=yes/no]

Where:

* link = the url of the source for the iFrame.  REQUIRED.
* tag = a unique identifier in case you want more than one iFrame on a page.  Default = auto-iframe.
* width = width of the iFrame (100% by default).  Can be % or px.  Default = 100%.
* height = the initial height of the iframe (100% by default).  Can be % or px.  Default = 100%.
* autosize = enable the auto sizing of the iFrame based on the content.  The initial height of the iFrame will be set to "height" and then resized.  Default = true.
* fudge = a fudge factor to apply when changing the height (integer number, no "px").  Default = 50.
* border = enable the border on the iFrame.  Default = 0.
* scroll = enable the scroll bar on the iFrame.  Default = no.
* query = pass the parent's page query string to the iFrame.  Default = no.

Note: Auto re-sizing of the iFrame for cross domain sites does not work, this is a security protection provided by the browser and there is no way around it.

Now supports (Shortcode UI)[https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake] (aka Shortcake)!

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the auto-iframe folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= The autosize function doesn't work, what's wrong? =

The first thing to check is that the source of your content is in the same domain namespace as your site, using a link from another domain name will not work as it would be a cross site scripting risk.  This is part of your browsers security structure and cannot be worked around.

After that, check your browsers console for any JavaScript errors that may be happening, there may be conflicting JavaScript on the page causing an error.
